REFERRAL SYSTEM
-----------------------------------

This repo is created to make a referral System using React , react-router-dom 6 and for tests I have used Test driven development using Jest and React testing library.

I have created a Project board consisting of all the tasks to be done

- [x] Creating a login page (Email , password and confirm password)
- [x] A user can login only when all the validations are correct 

    * Email needs to  be valid eg: abc@gmail.com else given an error Email is not valid
    * Email cannot be empty else give an error that Email is empty
    * Password cannot be empty else give error Password cannot be empty
    * Confirm password cannot be empty as well and it should match the password else it will give error that Passwords don't match

- [x] On logging user should be able to go to otp page
